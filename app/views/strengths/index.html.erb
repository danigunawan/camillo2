  Ideation is a form of art. So many ideas get lost because we feel we cannot spend the time to work on them fully. Instead of shunning them or throwing them away, 
  if we flip the script we can approach idea creation as a creative process that need not lead to a stalemate around what to do with all of these gems.
  Let em go. Or take the best and figure out which will be the focal point.
